#  Real-Time Fraud Detection System

A real-time fraud detection system that processes streaming transaction data and identifies potentially fraudulent activity using machine learning.

##  Overview

This project simulates a real-time pipeline for fraud detection, where incoming transactions are ingested, preprocessed, and evaluated by an ML model to flag suspicious behavior on the fly.

Built for high-throughput environments such as banking or e-commerce platforms.
